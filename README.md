## About the Project
Arnay Shukla is a co-developer of the project who has devised the logic working on the random placement of elements in the grid and solely
developing the code the for the movement of cursor, input the elements, and displaying the result. He is responsible for applying the sound
effects and developing the timer using in-built structures.

Anshul Tayal, co-developer, mainly focussed on the interlinking of the functions of the program. He worked on the areas concering presentation
and display of the project including headings and the Sudoku grid.

This is a fun-game built in C++ that helps you to enhance your critical and logical analysis, thus enabling your mind to function better
even under pressure.
